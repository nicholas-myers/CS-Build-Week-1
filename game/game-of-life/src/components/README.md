<!-- Dependencies you will need to install -->
1. Styled Components
2. Immer

<!-- Difficulties -->
Had a hard time trying to understand and implement canvas. Used Immer Library instead.
Had Difficulty when trying to manipulate the game using the Immer Library. I learned a lot about useCallback and useRef as well as how to use the Immer library.


<!-- TODO / WISH LIST -->
1. I definitely wish I could have had time to figure out and implement an 8 way Linked List. 
2. The next step would be to implement a doubly Linked List and Trees to improve on the 2D Array data structure which is not very efficient but is a good working first pass solution.
3. I would love to add more controls to the list to expand on user experience.
4. Add number notches to the sliders for easier indication of what speed and size you are at.
5. Add media queries.
